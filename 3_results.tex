	How does the performance of TwoPaCo improve \\to the increasing of working threads?
	 
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{images/scalability}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item First pass: great improvement thanks to concurrent bloom filter
	  \item Second pass: slight improvement due to race-conditions on the hash table
	  \item Edge construction: great improvement thanks to $k$-mers independency
